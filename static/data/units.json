It is equal to the energy transferred to (or work done on) an object when a force of one newton acts on that object in the direction of the force's motion through a distance of one metre (1 newton metre or N⋅m). It is also the energy dissipated as heat when an electric current of one ampere passes through a resistance of one ohm for one second. It is named after the English physicist James Prescott Joule (1818–1889)."},{"type":"SI","_id":"603c61faf22c5338f89555b1","category":{"_id":2,"name":"Physics","slug":"physics"},"name":"Kilogram","slug":"kilogram","symbol":"kg","description":"Mass is both a property of a physical body and a measure of its resistance to acceleration (a change in its state of motion) when a net force is applied.
