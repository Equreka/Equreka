[{"_id":"6040364e75de29277c377057","name":"Speed of light","slug":"speed-of-light","symbol":"c","description":"The speed of light in vacuum, commonly denoted c, is a universal physical constant important in many areas of physics. Its exact value is defined as 299792458 metres per second (approximately 300000 km/s, or 186000 mi/s). It is exact because, by international agreement, a metre is defined as the length of the path travelled by light in vacuum during a time interval of ​1⁄299792458 second. According to special relativity, c is the upper limit for the speed at which conventional matter, energy or any information can travel through coordinate space.","category":{"_id":2,"name":"Physics","slug":"physics"},"unit":{"type":"SI","_id":"6040404e81aecf71dcb06add","name":"Metre per second","slug":"metres-per-second","symbol":"m/s","description":"The metre per second is an SI derived unit of both speed (scalar quantity) and velocity (vector quantity (which have direction and magnitude)), equal to the speed of a body covering a distance of one metre in a time of one second."},"value":299792458,"values":[{"value":299792458,"exact":true,"unit":{"type":"SI","_id":"6040404e81aecf71dcb06add","name":"Metre per second","slug":"metres-per-second","symbol":"m/s","description":"The metre per second is an SI derived unit of both speed (scalar quantity) and velocity (vector quantity (which have direction and magnitude)), equal to the speed of a body covering a distance of one metre in a time of one second."}},{"value":"3·10⁸","exact":false,"unit":{"type":"SI","_id":"6040404e81aecf71dcb06add","name":"Metre per second","slug":"metres-per-second","symbol":"m/s","description":"The metre per second is an SI derived unit of both speed (scalar quantity) and velocity (vector quantity (which have direction and magnitude)), equal to the speed of a body covering a distance of one metre in a time of one second."}}]}]
