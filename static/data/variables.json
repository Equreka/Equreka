Energy is a conserved quantity; the law of conservation of energy states that energy can be converted in form, but not created or destroyed. The SI unit of energy is the joule, which is the energy transferred to an object by the work of moving it a distance of 1 metre against a force of 1 newton.","unit":"603a42a07abd113e30d8b30e","category":{"_id":2,"name":"Physics","slug":"physics"}},{"_id":"603b0955362a26563cabe4cc","name":"Mass","slug":"mass","symbol":"m","description":"Property of matter to resist changes of the state of motion and to attract other bodies","unit":"603c61faf22c5338f89555b1","category":{"_id":2,"name":"Physics","slug":"physics"}}]
