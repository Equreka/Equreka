Its exact value is defined as 299792458 metres per second (approximately 300000 km/s, or 186000 mi/s). It is exact because, by international agreement, a metre is defined as the length of the path travelled by light in vacuum during a time interval of ​1⁄299792458 second. According to special relativity, c is the upper limit for the speed at which conventional matter, energy or any information can travel through coordinate space.","unit":{"type":"SI","_id":"6040404e81aecf71dcb06add","name":"Metre per second","slug":"metres-per-second","symbol":"m/s","description":"The metre per second is an SI derived unit of both speed (scalar quantity) and velocity (vector quantity (which have direction and magnitude)), equal to the speed of a body covering a distance of one metre in a time of one second."},"value":299792458,"values":[{"value":299792458,"exact":true,"unit":"6040404e81aecf71dcb06add"},{"value":"3·10⁸","exact":false,"unit":"6040404e81aecf71dcb06add"}]}}],"expressionIntern":"\\var{E}=\\var{m}\\const{c}^{2}"},{"_id":"603a5b5b7abd113e30d8b30f","units":[],"category":{"_id":1,"slug":"mathematics","name":"Mathematics"},"name":"Pythagorean theorem","slug":"pithagoras-theorem","expression":"a^2+b^2=c^2","description":"Where $\\var{c}$ represents the length of the hypotenuse and $\\var{a}$ and $\\var{b}$ the lengths of the triangle's other two sides.
