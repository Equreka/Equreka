	description: 'The elementary charge, usually denoted by $e$ or sometimes $q_{e}$ is the electric charge carried by a single proton or, equivalently, the magnitude of the negative electric charge carried by a single electron, which has charge âˆ’1 $e$. This elementary charge is a fundamental physical constant. To avoid confusion over its sign, $e$ is sometimes called the elementary positive charge.',
