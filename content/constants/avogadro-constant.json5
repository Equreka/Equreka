	description: 'The Avogadro constant ($N_{\\rm {A}}$ or $L$) is the proportionality factor that relates the number of constituent particles (usually molecules, atoms or ions) in a sample with the amount of substance in that sample. Its SI unit is the reciprocal mole, and it is defined as $N_{A} = 6.02214076×10^{23} mol^{−1}$. It is named after the Italian scientist Amedeo Avogadro. Although this is called Avogadro\'s constant (or number), he is not the chemist who determined its value.',
