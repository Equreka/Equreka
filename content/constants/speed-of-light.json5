	name: 'Speed of light',
	symbol: 'c',
	description: 'The speed of light in vacuum, commonly denoted c, is a universal physical constant important in many areas of physics. Its exact value is defined as 299792458 metres per second (approximately 300000 km/s, or 186000 mi/s). It is exact because, by international agreement, a metre is defined as the length of the path travelled by light in vacuum during a time interval of ​1⁄299792458 second. According to special relativity, c is the upper limit for the speed at which conventional matter, energy or any information can travel through coordinate space.',
