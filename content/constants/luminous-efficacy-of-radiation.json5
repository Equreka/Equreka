	description: "<p>Unlike white light, which is made up of many components, monochromatic light is one that is made up of components of a single color. That is, it has a single wavelength, corresponding to that color.</p><p> This means that to produce monochromatic radiation, electrons are generated by heating a filament and then accelerated in an electromagnetic field, the high-energy electrons collide with an anode with enough speed to penetrate the outer electronic layers of the material of the anode. When the electron collides with the K shell of electrons, the incident electron removes its orbit to the K shell electron. The atom loses one of its K shell electrons and is in a metastable condition, consequently the L shell electron enters to fill layer K. </p><p> The most representative example of this type of light are laser diodes, since their wavelength varies only a few thousandths of a nanometer. It should be noted that pure monochromaticity does not exist as such, so it is therefore an ideal characteristic.</p>",
