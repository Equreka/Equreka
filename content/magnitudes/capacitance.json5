	description: 'Capacitance is the ratio of the amount of electric charge stored on a conductor to a difference in electric potential. There are two closely related notions of capacitance: self capacitance and mutual capacitance.â€Š Any object that can be electrically charged exhibits self capacitance. In this case the electric potential difference is measured between the object and ground.',
