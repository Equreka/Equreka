	description: '**Voltage, electric potential difference, electric pressure or electric tension** is the difference in electric potential between two points, which (in a static electric field) is defined as the work needed per unit of charge to move a test charge between the two points. In the International System of Units, the derived unit for voltage (potential difference) is named volt.In SI units, work per unit charge is expressed as joules per coulomb, where $1 ~volt = 1 ~joule$ (of work) per $1 ~coulomb$ (of charge).',
