	description: 'The coulomb (symbol: $C$) is the International System of Units (SI) unit of electric charge. Under the 2019 redefinition of the SI base units, which took effect on 20 May 2019, the coulomb is exactly $\\frac{1}{1.602176634×10^{−19}}$ elementary charges. The same number of electrons has the same magnitude but opposite sign of charge, that is, a charge of −1 C.',
