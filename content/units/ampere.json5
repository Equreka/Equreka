	description: 'The ampere, symbol $A$, is the SI unit of electric current ($I$). It is defined by taking the fixed numerical value of the elementary charge e to be $1.602 176 634e^{–19}$ when expressed in the unit $C$, which is equal to $A$ $s$, where the second is defined in terms of $\\Delta ν_{Cs}$.',
