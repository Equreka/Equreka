	description: 'The radian, denoted by the symbol ${\\displaystyle {\\text{rad}}}{\\displaystyle {\\text{rad}}}$, is the SI unit for measuring angles, and is the standard unit of angular measure used in many areas of mathematics. The unit was formerly an SI supplementary unit (before that category was abolished in 1995) and the radian is now an SI derived unit. The radian is defined in the SI as being a dimensionless value, and its symbol is accordingly often omitted, especially in mathematical writing.',
