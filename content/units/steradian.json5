	description: 'The steradian (symbol: $sr$) or square radian is the SI unit of solid angle. It is used in three-dimensional geometry, and is analogous to the radian, which quantifies planar angles. Whereas an angle in radians, projected onto a circle, gives a length on the circumference, a solid angle in steradians, projected onto a sphere, gives an area on the surface. The name is derived from the Greek στερεός stereos "solid" + radian. \n \
						\n The steradian, like the radian, is a dimensionless unit, the quotient of the area subtended and the square of its distance from the center. Both the numerator and denominator of this ratio have dimension length squared (i.e. $L^{2}/L^{2}$ = 1, dimensionless). It is useful, however, to distinguish between dimensionless quantities of a different nature, so the symbol $sr$ is used to indicate a solid angle. ',
