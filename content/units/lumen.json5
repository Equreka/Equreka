	description: 'The lumen (symbol: $lm$) is the SI derived unit of luminous flux, a measure of the total quantity of visible light emitted by a source per unit of time. Luminous flux differs from power (radiant flux) in that radiant flux includes all electromagnetic waves emitted, while luminous flux is weighted according to a model (a "luminosity function") of the human eye\'s sensitivity to various wavelengths. Lumens are related to lux in that one lux is one lumen per square metre.'
