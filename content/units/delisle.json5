	description: 'The Delisle scale is a way of measuring temperature conceived in 1732 by the French astronomer Joseph-Nicolas Delisle (1688-1768). Its units are degrees Delisle, they are represented by the symbol $°D$ and each one is equal to −2/3 of a degree Celsius or Kelvin. The zero of the scale is at the boiling temperature of water and measures 150 $°D$ for the melting of water, it increases as the other scales descend until it reaches absolute zero at 559.725 $°D$.',
