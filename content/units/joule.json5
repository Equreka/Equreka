	description: 'The joule (/dʒaʊl, dʒuːl/ jowl, jool) is a derived unit of energy in the International System of Units. It is equal to the energy transferred to (or work done on) an object when a force of one newton acts on that object in the direction of the force\'s motion through a distance of one metre (1 newton metre or $N⋅m$). It is also the energy dissipated as heat when an electric current of one ampere passes through a resistance of one ohm for one second. It is named after the English physicist James Prescott Joule (1818–1889).'
