	description: 'This formula states that the equivalent $energy$ $(\\mag{E})$ can be calculated as the mass $(\\mag{m})$ multiplied by the speed of light $(\\const{c})$ squared. Similarly, anything having energy exhibits a corresponding mass $(\\mag{m})$ given by its energy $(\\mag{E})$ divided by the speed of light squared $(\\const{c}^{2})$. \n \
						Because the speed of light is a very large number in everyday units, the formula implies that even an everyday object at rest with a modest amount of mass has a very large amount of energy intrinsically.',
