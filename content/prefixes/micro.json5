	description: 'Micro (symbol $μ$) is a unit prefix in the metric system denoting a factor of $10^{6}$ (one millionth). Confirmed in 1960, the prefix comes from the Greek μικρός (mikrós), meaning "small". \n \
	\n The symbol for the prefix is the Greek letter $μ$ (mu). It is the only SI prefix which uses a character not from the Latin alphabet. "mc" is commonly used as a prefix when the character "μ" is not available; for example, "mcg" commonly denotes a microgram. This is ambiguous, in that mcg could also be read as a micrigram, i.e. $10^{−14} g$, the prefix $micri$ is not standard, nor widely known, and considered obsolete. The letter $u$, instead of $μ$, is allowed by an ISO document.',
