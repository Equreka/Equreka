	description: 'Yotta is the largest decimal unit prefix in the metric system, denoting a factor of $10^{24}$ or $1000000000000000000000000$, or one septillion. It has the symbol Y. The prefix name is derived from the Ancient Greek ὀκτώ (oktṓ), meaning eight, because it is equal to $1000^{8}$. It was added as an SI prefix to the International System of Units (SI) in 1991.',
