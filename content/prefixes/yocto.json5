	description: 'Yocto (symbol $y$) is a unit prefix in the metric system denoting a factor of $10^{−24}$ or $0.000000000000000000000001$. It was adopted in 1991 by the General Conference on Weights and Measures. It comes from the Ancient Greek οκτώ, meaning "eight", because it is equal to $1000^{−8}$.
