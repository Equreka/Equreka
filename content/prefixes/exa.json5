	description: 'Exa (symbol $E$) is a decimal unit prefix in the metric system denoting $10^{18}$ or $1000000000000000000$. It was added as an SI prefix to the International System of Units (SI) in 1975. \n \
	\n Exa comes from the ancient Greek ἕξ héx, used as a prefix ἑξά- hexá-, meaning six (like hexa-), because it is equal to $1000^{6}$.',
