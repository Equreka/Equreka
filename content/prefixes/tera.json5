	description: 'Tera is a unit prefix in the metric system denoting multiplication by one trillion, or $10^{12}$ or 1000000000000 (one trillion short scale; one billion long scale). It has the symbol $T$. Tera is derived from the Greek word τέρας teras, meaning "monster"; also it resembles tetra, meaning "four" but with the middle letter removed as it is the fourth power of 1000. The unit prefix was confirmed for use in the International System of Units (SI) in 1960.',
